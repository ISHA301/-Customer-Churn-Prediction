# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Python

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a real-world telecom dataset. The goal is to analyze patterns in customer behavior and identify those likely to leave the service, enabling the business to take proactive retention steps.

## 📁 Project Overview

**Business Context:**  
Churn (customer leaving the service) can significantly impact revenue. By analyzing historical customer data, we can understand the characteristics of customers who tend to churn and take action accordingly.

**Project Goal:**  
- Use Python for data cleaning, analysis, and predictive modeling.  
- Understand key customer attributes that influence churn.  
- Build an interpretable churn prediction model using logistic regression.  
- Generate actionable business insights from data exploration.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Seaborn, Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Model building and evaluation

## ✅ Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Loaded the dataset from CSV.
- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric and dropped rows with missing values.
- Removed unnecessary identifiers like `customerID`.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized churn distribution and customer trends using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.
- Analyzed average values of `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, and `TotalCharges` across churned vs non-churned customers.
- Explored the relationship between churn and services like internet type, contract length, and tech support.
  
### 3. Feature Engineering
- Created a new binary column: `Churn_Yes` (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
- Applied one-hot encoding to convert categorical columns into numerical format using `pd.get_dummies()`.

### 4. Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression
- Data was split into training and test sets using an 80-20 split.
- Logistic Regression model trained using `class_weight='balanced'` to handle class imbalance.
- Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 📈 Results

The model performed well with a 77% accuracy, and more importantly, it achieved strong recall on churned customers, making it useful for business retention efforts.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Data

- Customers with **short-term contracts**, **electronic check payments**, and no **technical support** are more likely to churn.
- Churned customers had **shorter tenure** and **higher monthly charges** on average.
- Lacking of services such as **online security** and **streaming options** also showed a correlation with churn behavior.

---

## 💼 Recommendations

- Promote longer-term contracts or bundled offers to reduce churn.
- Offer discounts or added value for customers using electronic check payments.
- Target at-risk customers with proactive support, especially those lacking tech support or online security.
